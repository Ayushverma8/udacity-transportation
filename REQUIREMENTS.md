## [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) Requirements
These are the requirements from Udacity.

### Public Transportation App

Prepare for this project with [JavaScript Promises](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud898) and [Building Offline-First Apps](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud899).

####Requirements

You must build an application that allows users to select a departure and arrival train station. The user will then see information about the two stations. The information you provide may include connected stations on the path, arrival & departure times, or any other information you deem important for the user. Initially, the application should load a default train schedule, this can be a general schedule, a live schedule, or simply a transit map - many public transportation agencies offer this information via an API, as a GTFS file (for example, [CalTrain](http://www.caltrain.com/developer.html) or the [My511.org](http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-data-feed.asp) transit data feed), or as an image. When the application is online the user should be able to see up to date information from the transit authority of choice. When offline the user should be able to continue to interact with the site in some capacity (e.g. The user has full access to the general schedule or the user is able to see route information they have accessed while online.)

Review the evaluation rubric for this project early and often.
